Good Shelf (yes, it's a stupid name)

Good SHelf is a basic plugin that allows the user to add a GoodReads.com RSS feed to there wordpress blog.

It was created so that I could display the books that i'm currently reading, 
either displaying the book cover images, the title of the book or both.

'txt' will either diplay or hide the Title of the book' options = TRUE/FALSE
'img' will either display or hide the book cover. options = TRUE/FALSE
